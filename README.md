## Introduction

### Background

Creating setup installers is a crucial aspect of software distribution. The project focuses on converting Python scripts into executable (.exe) files with future plans to expand into creating comprehensive setup installers.

### Objectives

The primary objectives include:

- Developing a user-friendly interface for generating setup installers.
- Allowing users to specify version details.
- Customizing license agreements.
- Providing options for incorporating additional files.
- Creating desktop shortcuts.

## Project Scope

The project currently concentrates on converting Python scripts to executable files. Future development aims to include the creation of full setup installers.

## Methodology

### Technologies Used

The project uses:

- Python (Tkinter for GUI)
- ThemedStyle for UI theming
- ttkthemes for themed widgets
- Threading for parallel execution
- Subprocess for executing command-line processes

## System Architecture

The system architecture involves a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter. Threading is used to run the setup creation process concurrently, preventing GUI freezing.

## Implementation

### User Interface

The Tkinter-based GUI offers an intuitive layout with themed widgets, providing a seamless user experience.

### Core Functionality

Key functionalities include:

- Executing a Python script (raj.py) to generate an executable (.exe) file.
- Gathering version details and customizing license agreements.
- Allowing users to incorporate additional files.
- Creating desktop shortcuts.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Focused on individual components, including file handling, GUI elements, and button functionalities.

### Integration Testing

Ensured that different modules work seamlessly together.

## Results

The application successfully converts Python scripts into executable setup installers, allowing customization of version details, licensing, and inclusion of additional files.

## Challenges

Challenges during development included handling file paths, ensuring proper cleanup, and managing user inputs.

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include:

- Extending functionality to create a setup installer from an executable (.exe) file.
- Supporting additional customization options.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback.
- Integration with version control systems.

## Conclusion

The Setup Installer Generator project efficiently addresses the challenges of creating setup installers for Python projects. Its interface and functionality make it a valuable tool for developers. Future iterations are planned to extend its functionality.
